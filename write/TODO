Time for a zoom meeting the week of 12th August with Jason Roberts and we can discuss the project in more detail

I sent you the Castleman et al. (2022) paper - did you have a good read of that? 

Larour et al. (2011) paper, which lays out the ISSM model that we'll be using, and getting your head around the governing equations of ice sheet models (in that paper, but you could follow the rabbit hole to do some more exploration as well). 

Does that sound ok?
