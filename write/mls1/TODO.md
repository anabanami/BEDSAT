- Complete the missing literature review section

- Add interpretation of phase analysis results:
    An isolated bump differs from the 90Â° prediction. Because the derivation in the Budd's 1970 is based on a periodic, harmonic bedrock (continuous, infinitely repeating cosine wave). The bump in IsmipF is a fundamentally different geometry. It does not have a single wavelength and introduces edge effects not accounted for in this periodic model.

- Clarify how the rheology study connects to the inversion methodology
    SO WHAT HOW CAN I USE the sliding study in the inversion method?
       - different transfer functions for different rheological assumptions? 
       - test which rheology best matches observed data?


- Consider whether your timeline is realistic or if scope adjustment is needed

- Include more discussion of limitations and potential challenges

    Obtain ML Training Data: According to your timeline, the task to "Obtain ML training data" begins in September 2025. Your report states that this will involve using your validated framework to create a large dataset of bed-to-surface response features from various synthetic bedrock topographies, which can then be used to train a machine learning model.


Following these immediate steps, you will proceed with the remaining tasks for Objective 1, leading into 2026:

    Model Experiments and ML Training: Once the training data is generated, you will begin the "Model experiments and ML training" phase.

After completing Objective 1, your project will progress sequentially to your other main objectives:

    Objective 2: Apply the BedSAT methodology to derive a new, continent-wide bed topography for Antarctica.

Objective 3: Use the new topography datasets to evaluate the impact on ice mass loss projections through sensitivity analyses.
