        ISMIP-HOM Recreation (Section 4.1) should I include the results from ISMIP HOM>??

Areas for Consideration and Improvement (Real Feedback)

    Minor Typos and Phrasing:

        On Page 18, under the heading for the Grid Independence Study, you have "A standardized 2×2 plot ??is generated...". The question marks are clearly a placeholder.

    Sharpening the Research Questions:

        In Section 3.1, your three research questions are good, but questions 2 and 3 feel quite similar.

            Q2: To what extent do interpolation uncertainties... affect... simulations?

            Q3: What is the impact of variable bed conditions and topography on... GL retreat?

        You could sharpen the distinction. For instance, Q2 could be framed more specifically around the propagation of uncertainty (i.e., how does input uncertainty translate to output uncertainty?), while Q3 could focus more on the physical mechanisms (i.e., which specific topographic features—roughness, pinning points—have the most significant dynamic impact on retreat?). This isn't a major change, but it could make their individual contributions clearer.

    Fleshing out the "Progress" Section by adding results and analysis

        The headings on Page 18 (e.g., "Key Findings: The Grid Independence Study", "Phase Analysis") need to be followed by text and the corresponding plots.

        Suggestion for your Phase Analysis: When you present these results, make sure to explicitly link them back to Budd's theory. For example: "As predicted by Budd (1970), our simulations with linear rheology (n=1) show a phase shift of approximately π/2. However, under non-linear rheology (n=3), this phase relationship is altered, particularly for wavelengths of X, which has significant implications for inversion models."

    Figure Captions:

        Your figure captions are generally good and descriptive. To make them even better, consider making them fully self-contained. For example, in Figure 4.1, you could add a sentence explaining the purpose of the experiment, e.g., "This experiment tests the model's handling of stress gradients induced by 3D basal topography in the absence of sliding." This helps a reader understand the figure's importance without having to hunt for context in the main text.

    A Concluding Paragraph:

        The report currently ends with the bibliography. Consider adding a very brief concluding section (a single paragraph would suffice) after the Progress chapter. This could summarize the project's status and reiterate your confidence in the plan. Something like: "In summary, this report has outlined the critical role of bed topography in Antarctic ice sheet stability. Significant progress has been made in establishing and validating a robust computational framework. The foundational experiments detailed herein confirm that the project is well-positioned to achieve its objectives of developing the BedSAT method, deriving a new continental dataset, and quantifying its impact on sea-level rise projections."
