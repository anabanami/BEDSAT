Areas needing attention:

Literature review gap: Section 2.1.1 "BED LIT-REV" is completely empty (page 7). This appears to be a placeholder that needs content.

Methods clarity: While you outline your three objectives clearly, the transition from your current work (rheology study) to the actual BedSAT inversion method isn't fully explained. How exactly will your rheology findings inform the inversion framework?

Phase analysis results: You show figures 4.12-4.14 demonstrating phase shift analysis, but there's no discussion of what these results mean or how they compare to Budd's theoretical predictions of Ï€/2 phase lag.

Writing consistency: Some sections switch between technical detail and high-level overview without clear transitions. For example, the sudden jump from convergence analysis to phase analysis could use better connecting text.

Timeline concerns: Your timeline shows O1 extending well into 2027, but your thesis submission is marked for early 2028. This leaves very limited time for O2 (continental-scale application) and O3 (sensitivity analysis) - perhaps 6-12 months total. This seems ambitious given the scope.

Specific suggestions:

Complete the missing literature review section
Add interpretation of your phase analysis results
Clarify how the rheology study connects to the inversion methodology
Consider whether your timeline is realistic or if scope adjustment is needed
Include more discussion of limitations and potential challenges

The computational work is impressive and the research question is significant. With some structural improvements and filling in the gaps, this will be a strong milestone report.



=============================================================


Based on your project timeline and the progress described in your report, here is a summary of what you need to do next.

Your immediate priorities for the next few months (September - December 2025) are focused on continuing Objective 1 and preparing for your next milestone:

    Obtain ML Training Data: According to your timeline, the task to "Obtain ML training data" begins in September 2025. Your report states that this will involve using your validated framework to create a large dataset of bed-to-surface response features from various synthetic bedrock topographies, which can then be used to train a machine learning model.

Attend Professional Development: You have the Karthaus Summer School scheduled for September 2025.

Prepare for Confirmation: Your "Confirmation" milestone is scheduled for late 2025. The comprehensive work detailed in this report will serve as an excellent foundation for this.

Continue Developing the BedSAT Method: You will continue the primary task of "Derive the BedSAT method," which is the core of Objective 1.

Following these immediate steps, you will proceed with the remaining tasks for Objective 1, leading into 2026:

    Model Experiments and ML Training: Once the training data is generated, you will begin the "Model experiments and ML training" phase.

Write First Paper: The final step for this objective is the "Data analysis & Objective 1 paper". Your report notes that the foundational analysis of bed-to-surface signal transfer will form the basis of this first peer-reviewed manuscript.

After completing Objective 1, your project will progress sequentially to your other main objectives:

    Objective 2: Apply the BedSAT methodology to derive a new, continent-wide bed topography for Antarctica.

Objective 3: Use the new topography datasets to evaluate the impact on ice mass loss projections through sensitivity analyses.
