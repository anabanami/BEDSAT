I'd recommend the structure of the literature review to be something like the following: 

- then articulate how people have previously constructed bed topography and the problems associated with those methods (1-2 paragraphs; drawing from the same information you have on page 6, but condense into 1/2 page)

- present the surface-bed relationship as a tractable way forward (up to 1 page for detailed information). paragraph on studies that have used this approach (budd, ockenden, gudmundsson) and what they have found (i.e. how do bed features imprint on surface). paragraph on the limitations of past approaches, and where the gaps are (e.g. Newtonian; ignore sliding, etc.). paragraph on where there are advantages to be harnessed -- e.g. the fact that we can harness a wealth of surface data at high resolution, which are currently underutilised; by combining these data with models and machine learning ( a new approach that you will use), we can go further in ensuring that we're adhering to real ice dynamics (non-Newtonian; different sliding behaviours) in a tractable way 

- finish by articulating your overall aim in 1 sentence, then posing 3 specific objectives that your study will address


recommend that in the methods section you talk to the fact that you need to filter surface features that are not likely to be imprints of the bed, but that you will do that in consultation with experts (e.g. Andrew Gunn). Having aeolian dunes in your lit review will expose you to critique and I it's not the focus of your research -- they're noise to you



subsection: 1.2.3 Bridging Classical and Modern Approaches
the panel might ask you about circularity here -- ie you use the model to make the bed, then you use the bed to drive the model. how do you know you're not preconditioning certain beavhiours. recommend to think about this and be prepared to answer a question about it. we can discuss when we do a run through of your talk if you like -- this is a problem that's pretty ubiquitous
