\section{Aims}
 My research plan is structured around these three broad research questions:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How does the bed topography manifest on the ice surface?
    \item To what extent do interpolation uncertainties in bed topography datasets affect the accuracy of Antarctic Ice Sheet evolution simulations under different climate change scenarios?
    \item What is the impact of variable bed conditions and topography on the rate of grounding line (GL) retreat in continental ice sheets?
\end{enumerate}
Underpinning these research questions are the following objectives (O):
\begin{itemize}
    \item{O1:} Develop an ice sheet modelling approach to assimilate satellite remote sensing datasets to improve knowledge of the bed (BedSAT) informed by mathematical models of ice flow over topography;
    \item{O2:} Derive a new bed topography for Antarctica using BedSAT;
    \item{O3:} Evaluate the impact of the improved bed topography on projections of ice mass loss from Antarctica under climate warming through sensitivity analyses. 
\end{itemize}
