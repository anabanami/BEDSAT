\begin{enumerate}
\item \textbf{Adaptive Mesh Refinement}: A technique used to refine the mesh in regions of high variability or complexity, enhancing model accuracy and efficiency.
\item \textbf{Asperity}: A protrusion or bump on a surface. Roughness The unevenness of a surface, characterized by the size and distribution of asperities.
\item \textbf{Basal Drag Coefficient}: A parameter representing the frictional resistance between the ice sheet base and the underlying bedrock.
\item \textbf{Basal Melt Rates}: The rate at which the underside of a glacier or ice sheet melts due to contact with warmer ocean water.
\item \textbf{Basal sliding}: Sliding occurring at the base of a glacier.
\item \textbf{Bedrock Topography}: The shape and elevation of the solid rock surface beneath a glacier or ice sheet.
\item \textbf{Blatter-Pattyn Approximation (BP)}: A higher-order ice flow model that incorporates longitudinal stresses, making it suitable for simulating fast-flowing ice streams and regions with significant vertical shear.
\item \textbf{Calving}: The process by which icebergs break off from the edge of a glacier or ice sheet.
\item \textbf{Coefficient of sliding friction (µ)}: The ratio of the shear stress to the normal stress during steady-state sliding.
\item \textbf{Coefficient of static friction (µs)}: The ratio of the limiting static shear stress to the normal stress, indicating the resistance to sliding from rest.
\item \textbf{Data Assimilation}: The process of incorporating observational data into a model to improve its accuracy and predictive capabilities.
\item \textbf{Finite Element Method (FEM)}: A numerical method for solving partial differential equations by dividing the domain into smaller elements and approximating the solution within each element.
\item \textbf{Full-Stokes (FS)}: The most comprehensive and computationally expensive ice flow model, accounting for all stress components. Essential for accurately simulating ice flow near grounding lines.
\item \textbf{Global Mean Sea-Level Rise (SLR)}: The average increase in sea level across the globe due to various factors, including melting of glaciers and ice sheets, and thermal expansion of ocean water.
\item \textbf{Grounding Line}: The boundary where the ice sheet transitions from grounded ice to floating ice (ice shelf).
\item \textbf{Ice-Penetrating Radar}: A remote sensing technique used to map the bedrock topography beneath glaciers and ice sheets by transmitting radar waves through the ice.
\item \textbf{Ice Sheet System Model (ISSM)}: A finite element, thermomechanical ice flow model that incorporates SIA, SSA, BP, and FS formulations to simulate ice sheet behaviour at various complexities and spatial resolutions.
\item \textbf{InSAR}: Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar, a remote sensing technique used to measure ice surface velocity.
\item \textbf{Limiting dynamic shear stress (Tm)}: The shear stress at which a glacier or ice block transitions from steady-state sliding to accelerated sliding.
\item \textbf{Limiting static shear stress (TS)}: The minimum shear stress required to initiate sliding from a resting position.
\item \textbf{Marine Ice Sheet Instability}: A process where the grounding line of an ice sheet retreats into deeper water, leading to accelerated ice discharge and potentially unstoppable collapse.
\item \textbf{Normal stress (N)}: The force acting perpendicular to a surface, per unit area. In the context of glaciers, it is primarily the weight of the overlying ice.
\item \textbf{Pinning Point}: A topographic feature, such as a ridge or mountain, that can slow or temporarily halt the retreat of a glacier's grounding line.
\item \textbf{Regelation}: The process of melting under pressure and refreezing at lower pressure, potentially contributing to ice sliding.
\item \textbf{Retrograde Bedrock Slope}: A bedrock slope that deepens inland, making the ice sheet more susceptible to marine ice sheet instability.
\item \textbf{Shallow Ice Approximation (SIA)}: A simplified ice flow model that considers only vertical shear stresses and neglects horizontal stress gradients. Suitable for slow-moving ice in the interior of ice sheets.
\item \textbf{Shallow Shelf Approximation (SSA)}: A simplified ice flow model that neglects vertical shear stresses and assumes depth-independent horizontal velocity. Appropriate for modelling floating ice shelves and fast-flowing ice streams.
\item \textbf{Shear stress (T)}: The force acting parallel to a surface, per unit area. In the context of glaciers, it is the force driving glacier motion.
\item \textbf{Sliding}: The movement of a glacier over its bed by sliding rather than internal deformation.
\item \textbf{Steady-state velocity (Vb)}: The constant velocity reached by a glacier or ice block when the driving shear stress is balanced by resisting forces.
\item \textbf{Stress Balance}: The equilibrium between the forces acting on an ice sheet, including gravity, basal friction, and internal ice stresses.
\item \textbf{Temperate ice}: Ice at or near its pressure-melting point.
\item \textbf{Volume Above Floatation (VAF)}: The volume of an ice sheet that is grounded on bedrock and contributes to sea-level rise if it melts or slides into the ocean.
\item \textbf{Wavelet Decomposition}: A mathematical technique that analyzes a signal by decomposing it into different frequency components at various spatial scales.
