\section*{Climate Impacts and Global Significance}

The polar regions are losing ice, and their oceans are changing rapidly\cite{O_C_in_changingClimate}. The consequences of this extend to the whole planet and it is crucial for us to understand them to be able to evaluate the costs and benefits of potential mitigation. 

The consequences of changes in different kinds of polar ice manifest across multiple interconnected systems. Of particular concern is the accelerating loss of continental ice sheets (permanent glacial ice masses on land) in both Greenland and Antarctica, which has become a major contributor to global sea level rise\cite{O_C_in_changingClimate}. Impacts extend beyond direct ice loss: As fresh water from melting ice sheets is added into the ocean, it increases ocean stratification. Cold freshwater can dissolve larger amounts of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ than regular ocean water. Increased $\mathrm{CO_2}$ uptake by polar oceans is creating corrosive conditions for calcifying organisms\cite{O_C_in_changingClimate}. In addition, freshwater stratification threatens to disrupt global thermohaline circulation\cite{Jacobs_2004} by decreasing the natural mixing of the ocean layers.
 
While there is high confidence in current ice loss and retreat observations in many areas, there is more uncertainty about the mechanisms driving these changes and their future progression\cite{Kemper_2021}. Uncertainty increases in regions with variable bed conditions, where characteristics like "slipperiness" and roughness are difficult to verify via direct samples.

Bed topography is one of the most crucial boundary conditions that influences ice flow and loss from the Antarctic Ice Sheet (AIS)\cite{Morlighem_2020}. Bed topography datasets are typically generated from airborne radar surveys, which are sparse and unevenly distributed across the Antarctic continent (see figure \ref{fig:BedMAP}). Interpolation schemes to "gap fill" these sparse datasets yield bed topography estimates that have high uncertainties (i.e. multiple hundreds of metres in elevation uncertainty; Morlighem et al., 2020) which propagate in simulations of AIS evolution under climate change\cite{Castleman_2022}. Given the logistical challenges of accessing large parts of the Antarctic continent, there is a crucial need for alternative approaches, that integrate diverse and possibly more spatially complete data streams â€“ including satellite data.

\section*{Ice Sheet Bed Reconstruction via Surface Data Inversion}\label{Ockenden_2022}
% you could also set this up by including a short paragraph at the end of the previous sentence. either way, this paragraph needs a topic sentence that gives this paragraph context
% lmk if you want to chat about this in more detail
An important observation is that features in the ice bed often show up as subtle patterns in the ice surface topography above them\cite{Ockenden_2022}. These bed conditions - both their shape and mechanical properties - significantly influence how ice flows, with even small changes at the bed potentially leading to large differences in predicted ice loss rates% can you add a citation here?
To address this challenge, it is common to use inversion methods to estimate the geophysical conditions at the ice sheet bed. An example is outlined below.

\subsection*{Theoretical Framework}

Inversion is based on the principle that variations in basal topography, slipperiness, and roughness cause disturbances to the surface flow of the ice. By measuring these disturbances in surface velocity and topography, and using equations like the shelfy-stream approximation (SSA) to relate those disturbances back to their source, we can estimate the basal conditions.
The indirect estimate of basal property $x$ and surface property $y$ are related through $y=f(x)$, where $f$ is referred to as the forward model, this makes  $x=f^{-1}(y)$ the inversion. Property $y$ can be measurements of velocity and topography along the upper surface of a glacier, while the quantity $x$ to be estimated represents basal topography and basal slipperiness\cite{Gudmundsson_2008}.
The inversion method developed by Ockenden et al. in\cite{Ockenden_2022} introduces perturbations to study how small changes in ice thickness ($h$), surface elevation ($s$), basal topography ($b$), and ice velocity ($u$) affect ice flow. This means that the method is most accurate when applied to pertirbations, small relative to the mean of each studied property (based on a reference state). The method assumes:
\begin{enumerate}
    % this needs explanation, paricularly given that ice is not linearly viscous, but typically has n=4 (or n=3)
\item A linear viscous medium ($n=1$)
\item Non-linear sliding law ($m>0$)
\item Steady-state conditions
\item Spatially constant zero-order solutions
\end{enumerate}

The SSA system described in Ockenden et al.\cite{Ockenden_2022} is as follows:
\begin{equation}\partial_{x} (4 h \eta \partial_{x} u + 2 h \eta \partial_y v) + \partial_{y}(h \eta( \partial_{x} v + \partial_{y} u)) - (u/c^{1/m}) = \rho g h ( \partial_{x} (s) \mathrm{cos}(\alpha) - \mathrm{sin}(\alpha))
\end{equation}\label{eq:2.1}\\
\begin{equation}\partial_{y} (4 h \eta \partial_{y} v + 2 h \eta \partial_x u) + \partial_{x}(h \eta( \partial_{y} u + \partial_{x} v)) - (v/c^{1/m}) = \rho g h ( \partial_{y} (s) \mathrm{cos}(\alpha)
\end{equation}\label{eq:2.2}

Equations \ref{eq:2.1} and \ref{eq:2.2} are a linearised system around a reference model $(\bar{h}, \bar{s}, \bar{b}, \bar{u}, \bar{v}, \bar{c})$, leading to first-order momentum balance equations:
\begin{equation}
4 \eta \bar{h} \partial_{xx} \Delta u + 3 \eta \bar{h} \partial_{xy}^{2} \Delta v + \eta \bar{h} \partial_{yy}^{2}\Delta u -\gamma \Delta u  = \rho g \bar{h}\mathrm{cos}(\alpha) \partial_x \Delta s - \rho g \mathrm{sin}(\alpha)\Delta h
\end{equation}\\
\begin{equation}
4 \eta \bar{h} \partial_{yy} \Delta v + 3 \eta \bar{h} \partial_{xy}^{2} \Delta u + \eta \bar{h} \partial_{xx}^{2}\Delta v -\gamma \Delta v  = \rho g \bar{h}\mathrm{cos}(\alpha) \partial_y \Delta s
\end{equation}

where $h$ represents ice thickness, $s$ surface elevation, $(u, v)$ horizontal components of surface velocity, $c$ basal slipperiness, $\eta$ effective ice viscosity, $m$ sliding law parameter, $\rho$ ice density, $\alpha$ mean surface slope in $x$-direction (zero mean slope in $y$-direction), and $g$ acceleration due to gravity.

A disadvantage of the  assumptions above is that they can limit how well we can model the behavior of real ice which exhibits nonlinear rheology.

\subsection*{Transfer Functions and Implementation}

The methodology in \cite{Ockenden_2022} employs transfer functions. Transfer functions are mathematical expressions that describe how perturbations in basal topography and slipperiness affect surface topography and velocity. They are derived from the SSA equations
$$\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{s} \\
\hat{u} \\
\hat{v}
\end{bmatrix} =\begin{bmatrix}
T_{sb} & T_{sc} \\
T_{ub} & T_{uc} \\
T_{vb} & T_{vc}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\hat{b}\\
\hat{c}
\end{bmatrix}$$
The system is solved using a weighted least-squares approach, minimizing:
\begin{equation}
\Sigma s(s_{\mathrm{obs}} - s_{\mathrm{pred}})^2 + \Sigma u(u_{\mathrm{obs}} - u_{\mathrm{pred}})^2 + \Sigma v(v_{\mathrm{obs}} - v_{\mathrm{pred}})^2
\end{equation}

Inversion combines the surface data with the transfer functions to estimate the bed properties that would cause the surface changes.

\subsection*{Application and Limitations}

Ockenden et al. report to have successfully implemented their inversion method using REMA surface elevation data (8m resolution) and NASA ITS\_LIVE velocity data (120m resolution). The method performs particularly well in:
\begin{itemize}
\item Areas with moderate topographic gradients in the central trunk of glaciers
\item Features not aligned with ice flow direction
\item Medium-wavelength (5-50km) bedrock features
\end{itemize}
However, the method faces limitations in cases of:
\begin{itemize}
    % are these specific aspects that you're planning to focus on here? how might you extend Ockenden's work, or introduce novel approaches? 
\item Steep topography where shallow-ice-stream approximation breaks down
\item Features aligned with ice flow direction
\item Variable slipperiness parameters
\item Lack of validation data for slipperiness predictions
\end{itemize}

%  I think this section would benefit from a final paragraph that highlights the specific problem: i.e., that we have all this information about ice dynamics, and some of it is evident in datasets like surface elevations from satellite remote sensing (i.e., of surface features), but we're not harnessing that information to improve bed estimates, particularly where radar estimates might be sparse. so we need a way to mathematically link what's going on at the bed to the surface (and vice versa). perhaps include a very brief overview of some already-available models (i.e. budd) that could do that

% I think this paragraph needs a bit of work. I was not entirely sure how it relates to what you're doing, so i'm wondering whether it'd be helpful to instead include an overview of Budd here, and then move most / the rest of this paragraph to the methodology. Then, recommend to give a more broad overview of how you will take the benefits of a few different approaches and integrate that within an ice sheet model? 

This work represents a significant advance in our ability to reconstruct bed conditions using surface data. Modern satellite technology provides unprecedented detail of ice sheet surface features through high-resolution elevation models and velocity measurements. However, we have yet to fully harness this wealth of surface information to improve bed topography estimates, particularly where radar estimates might be sparse.
The model developed by Budd in \cite{Budd_1970} relates ice flow over bedrock perturbations to surface expressions using a two-dimensional biharmonic stress equation. Budd's model simplifies the stress balance within the ice by assuming that most of the shear deformation happens at the base. It also explicitely considers longitudinal stresses and strain-rates. All these assumptions are similar to those of the SSA approach in Ockenden et al. While not directly using SSA equations or explicitly describing inverse methods, the concepts and relationships described by Budd in\cite{Budd_1970} emphasize how the stress and strain components are influenced by bed topography which in turn has a strong effect on surface features and ice flow. Similarly to Ockenden et al., Budd's model goes beyond a simple relationship between surface-slope variation and perturbation size, which is a limitation of simplified SSA models.
Interestingly, Budd's mathematical framework, despite being around for over five decades, is yet to be put to use in modern ice sheet modeling. This is especially surprising now that we have the computational power and high-resolution satellite data required for the broad scale application of the method. In this project, we aim to integrate this framework into ice sheet models using the Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM), potentially creating a systematic way to link what we can see on the surface observations to what's happening at the bed - especially in areas of sparse bed measurements.
