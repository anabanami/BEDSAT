\chapter{Objectives}

The overall aim of this project is to derive a new Antarctic bed topography using remote sensing data, airborne derived-estimates of the bed and ice sheet modelling. Using the new bed topography to improve understanding of the impact of fine-scale topographic roughness on ice and subglacial hydrological flow, and projections of ice mass loss under climate warming.\\
\\The specific objectives are:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Develop an ice sheet modelling approach to assimilate satellite remote sensing datasets to improve knowledge of the bed (BedSAT) informed by mathematical models of ice flow over topography;
    \item Derive a new bed topography for Antarctica using BedSAT;
    \item Conduct sensitivity analyses to understand the impact of the improved bed topography on projections of ice mass loss from Antarctica under climate warming.
\end{enumerate}
