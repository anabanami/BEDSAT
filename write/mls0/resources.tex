\chapter{Resources}\label{resources}
I require high performance computing resources (including compute and storage) from the National Computing Infrastructure (NCI). These resources are already available via a Flagship between NCI and the Monash-led Australian Research Council project Securing Antarctica’s Environmental Future (SAEF).

\section*{Currently available data and Framework}\label{data}
The project will make use of a number of new remote sensing datasets and software tools.

\begin{enumerate}
% recommend to include 1-2 sentences on each of these that say how you will use them / how they come into your study
    \item\textbf{Reference Elevation Model of Antarctica (REMA)}\\
   Constructed from hundreds of thousands of Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) derived from high-resolution Maxar satellite imagery, REMA is calibrated with Cryosat-2 and ICESat altimetry\cite{REMA}.

    \item\textbf{ITS\_LIVE Antarctic surface velocities and elevation}\\
    The NASA-administered ITS\_LIVE website provides automated, high-resolution datasets of Antarctic surface velocities and ice surface elevation change, derived from satellite observations~\cite{itslive}.

    \item\textbf{BedMAP}\\ 
    A suite of gridded products describing surface elevation, ice-thickness and the seafloor and subglacial bed elevation of Antarctica, based on a compilation of data collected by a large number of researchers using a variety of techniques, with the aim of representing a snap-shot of understanding of the Antarctic region\cite{Fretwell_2013}. BEDMAP lacks detailed information on bedrock type, sediment layers, or geothermal heat flux, all of which affect ice dynamics intruducing model uncertainty.

    \item\textbf{BedMachine Antarctica}\\
    A high-resolution map of Antarctic subglacial bed topography that provides unprecedented detail of basal features. The dataset combines multiple ice thickness measurements with mass conservation principles, satellite-derived ice flow velocities, and surface mass balance from regional atmospheric models\cite{Morlighem_2020}. Similarly to BedMAP, BedMachine does not explicitly model basal properties.

    \item\textbf{ICECAP}\\ 
    Collaborative Exploration of the Cryosphere through Airborne Profiling. Since 2012, the project has obtained extensive data on ice thickness mapping and surface elevation in regions of the East Antarctic grounding zone, also comprehensive gravity mapping in areas beneath the Totten Glacier cavity\cite{ICECAP}.

    \item\textbf{Ice-sheet and Sea-level System Model (ISSM)}\\
    ISSM is a finite-element numerical ice sheet model. It has been used to simulate the Antarctic Ice Sheet’s response to various climate scenarios and assess future mass loss contributions to sea level rise\cite{deRydt_2013, Morlighem_2020, ISSM}.
\end{enumerate}

\section*{Data management and archiving}

Data will be published adhering to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable), ensuring transparency and accessibility. The final bed topography datasets will be published at the Australian Antarctic Data Centre (AADC) under an open source licence. All production model outputs will be published with unique DOIs at repositories aligned with the corresponding journal articles. Model outputs will be archived to tape at NCI using existing SAEF resources, as well as backed up to storage available through Monash MASSIVE M3 account aligned with project supervisor Dr McCormack. All journal articles published through this project will be open source, and tier 1 journals will be targeted.

\section*{Risk}

The project is highly feasible and low risk, given that it is a desk-based modelling and data assimilation project. All the data to be used in this project are freely available for download, and project supervisors are experts in ice sheet modelling using ISSM. 

\subsection*{Fieldwork}
Fieldwork is not necessary to achieve the objectives of the project; however, there may be the opportunity to participate in fieldwork through the ICECAP airborne geophysics project (led CI of ICECAP is project supervisor Dr Jason Roberts, Australian Antarctic Division), which will be instrumental in training of geophysical instruments and in developing broader expertise in the field.
