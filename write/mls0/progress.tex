\chapter{Progress}

To date I have been studying the relationship between surface and bed topography in glaciers usin ice-sheet modeling with ISSM. Here I examine how bed undulations manifest at the surface with potential phase shifts. The model employs Full-Stokes equations, implementing a flowband ice model across a 4km domain with 50m resolution. The simulation features an 800m mean ice thickness over bedrock at 1000m elevation, with a -0.1 radians downward slope and cosine undulations (2640m wavelength, 100m amplitude). One goal is to verify \cite{Budd_1970}'s proposition about ice surface behaviour over bedrock undulations. The main model, \texttt{flowline8.py}, executes a 300-year transient Full-Stokes simulation using 1-year time steps. Supporting tools include \texttt{phase\_analysis.py} for examining bed-surface relationships and \texttt{plotting.py} for visualizing simulation fields, while accounting for thermal and mass balance parameters.
